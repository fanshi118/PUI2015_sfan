the reviews were ok, but on the superficial side 9/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

the plot is confusing for a few reasons:

unnecessary 3D

dots are too large and having no boundaries or transparency they blend

the tick labels overlap with the axis label. 

the orientation of the axis label is confusing (should be along the axis)

the labels are not clear: what is Reg?


NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================


jz1894
============

the choice of a single color colormap is great: it shows gradients intuitively without suggesting anything else. however the color map has a large gradient between the first and  second color (gray to pink) which is misleading as it separates the locations with this color as different, while the range is 0-2: an interval as any other in the carbon emission scale.

the upper range is not bound. it should be shown somewhere for reference what the true range is

the granularity is not explained. an explanation for it does not necessarily belong in the plot but if this were included in a document it should certainly be explained why some regions are very finely sampled and others are note 

alaska and hawaii are nicely included and separated appropriately but he gray lines (though the polygon around hawaii has a lot of sides that are not necessary separating empty space between HW and AK giving the odd impression that HW is surrounded

"Figure" is not needed in the figure title/caption



jjhall
============


tick and axis labels are too small

the colors indicate the structure in the data nicely but the three shades are not distinguishable by people affected by the most common color blind variety

in general the default 3 datapoints in the legend should be substitute with a single point, as they are reduntant, but in this case since the datapoints are small to allow to see the overlapping structure (presumably) the three datapoints are justified. 

10^0 should be replaced with 1, 10^1 with 10




hkb
============


the time series are of very different order of magnitude. thus all of them are invisible and cluster at the bottom . log y should be used.

why is the plot resolution so low?

there are too many time series on the plot. even with log space the result would likely be confusing. 

for the y ticks a compressed notation for the large numbers should be chosen to enhance readability

good legend and good size for the labels.

consider steps instead of lines joining points for time series
